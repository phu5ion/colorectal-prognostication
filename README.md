# Prognosticating colorectal cancer
This project showcases the methods used in our paper: Prognosticating Colorectal Cancer Recurrence using Machine Learning Techniques, available at (link). 
We are in the process of updating this repo to include a synthetic dataset with similar features, as well as a Jupyter Notebook documenting the code and methodology that we have employed.
